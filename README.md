# I.Am.Tru.Starr VR Experience

## About
This experience is the culmination of a collaborative project between RIT students and the musical artist I.Am.Tru.Starr. Our goal was to create a new media experience that represented the musican's music and personality.

## Details
The VR experience is the result of a semester long class at RIT where students from the schools GCCIS and CIAS are grouped together to create a new media music experience. Over the semester we conceptualized, design and developed a VR project that we believe represents I.Am.Tru.Starr

## Tech Details
This project has been created to be used with an Oculus VR HMD and the touch controllers. It utilizes the touch controllers to interact with objects in the environment. This project was created using Unity and its respective C# scripts
